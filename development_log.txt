DEVELOPMENT LOG MULTI-LAYER MODEL BUILDER:

-------------MODEL BUILD-------------
- Error handling
- better doc strings

- Model component set attributes
- ModelComponent include volatile consider
- model component construct strings in __call__ function and add in an "offset" parameter 
for future compartmental model implementations

- Define kbb strings in DiffusionRegime

- define __str__ representation in DiffusionRegime
- DiffusionRegime.savetxt()

- put in offset on i if multi-compartment model (maybe a much more "future" development)

- removed w and gas_conc from ModelComponent
