DEVELOPMENT LOG MULTI-LAYER MODEL BUILDER:

-------------MODEL BUILD-------------
- Error handling
- better doc strings

- Model component set attributes
- ModelComponent include volatile consider
- model component construct strings in __call__ function and add in an "offset" parameter 
for future compartmental model implementations

- Define kbb strings in DiffusionRegime $


- define __str__ representation in DiffusionRegime
- DiffusionRegime.savetxt()

- put in offset on i if multi-compartment model (maybe a much more "future" development)

- removed w and gas_conc from ModelComponent $

- need to consider stoichiometry ~~

- Make a Parameter class with name, bounds, value etc. ~~

- Add a "reactions_added" boolean attribute to ModelComponent - allow to check if the model build function has added reactive gain/loss to that model component $

- First order decay list supplied to ModelBuilder.build(). Will add first order decay to a list of components ~~ No, go with if reaction tuple length == 1

- Get Reaction Scheme to print out a readable reaction scheme for the user ~~

- Need to make it so that if nothing is supplied to diffusion dict for a component by user, deal with it in DiffusionRegime $

- Add to ModelBuilder.req_params as I build the model in ModelBuilder.build(), then define "unpack parameters" section at the end of the build() function
	- Add varying_parameters to the Simulate object later

- utility functions - make_component_dict()
